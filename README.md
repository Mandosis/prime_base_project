#Base Project
This is a bare bones project from which to start a new one without recreating the essentials each and every time. Overtime this will be added upon as my knowledge grows.

##index.html
Bare bones html dock with `app.js` and `stylesheet.css` linked to it.

##app.js
`app.js` is a JavaScript file containing only the creation date and the author (myself).

##stylesheet.css
This is a completely blank CSS file.
