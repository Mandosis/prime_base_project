#Base Project
This is a bare bones project from which to start new ones without recreating the bare essentials each and every time.

##index.html
Bare bones html document with `app.js` and `stylesheet.css` linked to it.

##app.js
`app.js` is a JavaScript document containing only the creation date and the author (myself).

##stylesheet.css
This is a completely blank CSS document.
